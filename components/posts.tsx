/* Explanation:
- Updated BlogPosts component to add more spacing between items (`space-y-6`).
- Added hover effect to links with `hover:bg-white/20` for light mode and `dark:hover:bg-neutral-800/20` for dark mode.
- Added padding (`p-4`) and rounded corners (`rounded-lg`) to each link for a more appealing card-like effect.
- Changed hover text color to `text-pink-300` for a more vibrant effect.
- Enhanced the gradient background, text, and overall styling for visual impact in both light and dark modes.
